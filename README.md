### about me

I am a Kernel Developer (cifs.ko) @ SUSE, based in São Paulo, Brazil (GMT -3), living with my [girlfriend and our dog in our beautiful apartment](https://decarv.github.io/misc/IMG_6706.jpg), and working from home.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo) (2020 - 2023).

In 2024, I contributed to the [pgagroal project, as part of Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/discussions/442).
