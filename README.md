### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Henrique!

I am a Software Engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (GMT -3), living with my [girlfriend and our dog in our beautiful apartment](https://decarv.github.io/misc/IMG_6706.jpg).

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo) (2020 - 2023).

I am currently working on projects for pgagroal. I am also looking into ways to contribute to Linux perf tool.

My academic journey has been a mix of algorithm and data structures design, performance-oriented programming, and networking. Recently, I've ventured into edge NLP techniques, while developing an deep search based information retrieval system for USP and tweaking with Retrieval Augmented Generation.

I also love [computer graphics](https://github.com/decarv/computer-graphics) â€“ dreaming of more time to immerse myself in it!

I currently work at Invista FIDC, an asset management company specialized in distressed assets and non-performing loans. We develop crawlers and data systems to assist analysts in decision making.
